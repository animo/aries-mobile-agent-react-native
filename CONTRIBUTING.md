## How to contribute

You are encouraged to contribute to the repository by **forking and submitting a pull request**.

Pull requests will be evaluated by the repository guardians on a schedule and if deemed beneficial will be committed to the master. Pull requests should have a descriptive name and include an summary of all changes made in the pull request description.
